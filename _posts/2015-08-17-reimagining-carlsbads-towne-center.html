<h4>Reimagining Carlsbad&rsquo;s Towne Center: Community Marketplace to Take New Life as The Beacon La Costa, Anchored by San Diego Region&rsquo;s First Equinox Fitness Club</h4>

<p>Retail center will offer high-end fitness, shopping and dining opportunities for surrounding coastal communities</p>

<p>August 17, 2015 12:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time</p>

<p>CARLSBAD, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The former La Costa Towne Center is going upscale, with a $15 million renovation, a new name and a fresh tenant mix featuring the San Diego debut of Equinox. The high-performance fitness brand will anchor the center in the long-shuttered storefront once occupied by a Vons grocery store.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Given the scarcity of upscale retailers and restaurants in this community, there is a growing demand for boutique retail centers like The Beacon&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the newly-christened The Beacon La Costa, the 123,000-square-foot property will be renovated and repositioned into a cohesive luxury retail center. The transformation will begin this fall and is expected to be completed by the end of next year.</p>

<p>Located at the southeast corner of El Camino Real and La Costa Avenue in close proximity to the Omni La Costa Resort &amp; Spa, Park Hyatt and Four Seasons Residence Club Aviara, The Beacon will offer a casual coastal fitness, dining and shopping experience for North County&rsquo;s affluent communities, including Carlsbad, Encinitas, La Costa, Rancho Santa Fe, Del Mar and Solana Beach.</p>

<p>Equinox &ndash; the first to open in the San Diego region &ndash; will occupy 31,000 square feet on the property and will offer its premier slate of exclusive services, including world-class personal trainers, state-of-the-art fitness equipment and a rejuvenating spa. In addition to Equinox, The Beacon will offer 62,000 square feet of premium retail space along with 30,000 square feet of office space, creating a new community destination strengthened by vibrant local businesses. The tenant mix will feature a variety of full-service and fast-casual gourmet restaurants, boutiques and specialty neighborhood services.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This project was in desperate need of capital infusion and a fresh tenant mix,&rdquo; said Scott Schonfeld, Principal of Linwood Ventures, which acquired the property in a joint venture with Centennial Real Estate Company and Angelo, Gordon &amp; Co. in October 2014. &ldquo;We are excited that Equinox has chosen The Beacon as the springboard for its expansion into San Diego. It&rsquo;s the perfect anchor for the unique community gathering place that we&rsquo;re going to create.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Given the scarcity of upscale retailers and restaurants in this community, there is a growing demand for boutique retail centers like The Beacon,&rdquo; added Don Moser of Retail Insite, the project&rsquo;s leasing broker.</p>

<p>In addition to the complete renovation of the anchor building for Equinox, the improvements will include fa&ccedil;ade enhancements and upgrades to the project&rsquo;s parking and common areas, including new parklets and outdoor dining terraces with sweeping views of the Batiquitos Lagoon and nature preserve directly across El Camino Real.</p>
