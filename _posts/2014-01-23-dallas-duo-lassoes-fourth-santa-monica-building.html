<p>ACQUISITION: Lincoln and Centennial buy Promenade property for $20.3 million.</p>

<p>SANTA Monica&rsquo;s Third Street Promenade, a top destination for tourists visiting the region, seems to hold a similar allure to out-of-town investors. Lincoln Property Co., in a joint venture with</p>

<p>Centennial Real Estate Co., last month bought the 28,000-square-foot food court building at 1315 Third St. Promenade for $20.3 million. The Dallas companies purchased the five-story</p>

<p>retail property from USA San Diego, which paid $18.1 million for the property in 2007, according to Los Angeles County records. The acquisition was the fourth that Lincoln</p>

<p>and Centennial have made together in Santa Monica in the last two years, including two office properties and one medical property. &ldquo;The property fits really well into our</p>

<p>portfolio and our strategy of buying well allocated assets with significant opportunity,&rdquo; said Scott Schoenfeld, managing partner at Centennial. &ldquo;In this case, we have a relatively</p>

<p>new property on the Promenade that really has not been touched since it was built.&rdquo; Built in 1993, the food court building was about 55 percent occupied at the time of sale.</p>

<p>Tenants include national fast-food chains McDonald&rsquo;s, Subway and a handful of regional eateries. Two of three levels of office space have been vacant for about six months.</p>

<p>David Binswanger, executive vice president in Southern California for Lincoln, said the co-owners plan to spend more than $3 million to reimagine the two-level food court,</p>

<p>as well as upgrade office space to attract creative tenants. &ldquo;We plan on doing a heavy cosmetic retrofit of the ground floor to open up the space,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;As the only food court on the Promenade,</p>

<p>we want to be respectful of price point, but we also want to upgrade the tenancy.&rdquo; Barry Beitler and Mike Rago of Beitler Commercial Realty were the brokers of record on the deal.</p>
