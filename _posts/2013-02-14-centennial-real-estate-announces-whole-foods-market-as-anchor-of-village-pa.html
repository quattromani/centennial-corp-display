<p><span style="line-height:1.6">DALLAS &ndash; Feb. 14, 2013 &mdash; Centennial Real Estate Company welcomes Whole Foods Market&reg; as the anchor of its Village Park at Colleyville shopping center. The 40,000 square foot new store has a projected opening of early-to-mid 2014 and will go into a space formerly occupied by Albertson&rsquo;s. Village Park is a 190,664 square foot center located at the southeast corner of Glade Road and Highway 26/Colleyville Blvd. in Colleyville, Texas.</span></p>

<p>Centennial plans to extensively renovate the center and adapt the space for the new Whole Foods Market store while also modernizing other retail areas. Centennial assembled the shopping center from three separate owners over the past 18 months, allowing the company to bring in Whole Foods Market and redevelop the existing retail space.</p>

<p>Mark Dixon, President/Southwest Region of Whole Foods Market, said, &ldquo;Colleyville&rsquo;s Village Park Shopping Center is a desirable location and a perfect fit for Whole Foods Market. With our current store in Arlington and future location in Highland Village, our westward expansion gives more guests a convenient location for natural and organic culinary options.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whole Foods will be a welcome addition to Colleyville as it is one of the most in-demand grocery store operators in the country, and the new store will offer an exciting and energetic environment for the residents of Colleyville and its surrounding areas,&rdquo; said Steven Levin, chief executive officer of Centennial Real Estate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Village Park&rsquo;s extensive redevelopment, we will construct a prominent storefront and entrance for Whole Foods Market while upgrading the appearance of the entire shopping center. Our plans include unique architectural features that combine new modern design with a concept that is consistent with the culture and setting of Colleyville,&rdquo; added Levin.</p>

<p>Centennial acquired Village Park with partners Gideon Interests, Inc. and Atlantic Creek Real Estate Partners, LLC. ViewPoint Bank provided the debt for the transaction.</p>
