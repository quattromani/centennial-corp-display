<p>Westfield Corp. has sold five shopping malls in the U.S. for $1.1 billion to reduce gearing and fund a property development program.</p>

<p>The sale along with another transaction in November would give Westfield about $1 billion in net proceeds, and reduce gearing -- its debt as a percentage of equity capital -- by 3 percent, the Australian owner of malls in U.S. and U.K. said in a statement in Sydney Monday. It will also dilute funds from operations by 3.5 cents a security, the company said.</p>

<p>Westfield will continue to hold a 20 percent interest in the five assets. The proceeds will also be used to fund the $11.4 billion development program that is estimated to yield 7 percent to 8 percent, Westfield said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our strategic focus is to create and operate flagship assets in leading markets and divest non-core assets,&rdquo; Co-Chief Executive Peter Lowy said in the statement. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s announcement marks a significant milestone in our divestment strategy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Westfield shares dropped 2.2 percent to A$9.49 at 10:32 a.m in Sydney, trimming gains for the year to 5.2 percent. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX 200 index rose 0.1 percent.</p>

<p>The sale of the five shopping malls to a joint venture comprising Centennial Real Estate Co., Montgomery Street Partners and USAA Real Estate settled Dec. 18, Westfield said.</p>
