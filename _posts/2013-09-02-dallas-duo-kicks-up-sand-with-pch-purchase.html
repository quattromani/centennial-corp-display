<p>FABULOUS beachside homes are not the only desirable properties along L.A.&rsquo;s coast. Lincoln Property Co., in a joint venture with Centennial Real Estate Co., has snatched up the 104,000-square-foot mixed use Sunset Coast Plaza office and retail complex at Sunset Boulevard and Pacific Coast Highway for $36.7 million. The two Dallas companies purchased the Class A property at 17383 W. Sunset Blvd. in late July from Embarcadero Capital Partners LLC of Belmont. Embarcadero acquired the property in 2004 for $24.5 million. The deal was the fifth office purchase forLincoln in Los Angeles this year and the third it has done with Centennial in the last couple of years. Together, they own two office properties and one medical property in Santa Monica. David Binswanger, executive vice president in Southern California for Lincoln, said the partners were attracted to the Pacific Palisades property because of its proximity to Santa Monica and its $354-a-square-foot price. &ldquo;We saw pricing in Santa Monica rise to more than $600 a foot and determined the opportunities there were going to be few and far between,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We bought this building at a huge price-per-pound discount.&rdquo; Scott Schonfeld, managing partner at Centennial, said the two companies plan to spend $1.6 million on a cosmetic renovation to update the building and an additional $1.4 million to rebrand and market the property and cover leasing costs. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re currently working to finalize those plans and should be starting construction shortly,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an A-plus location withoutstanding views and we want to make the physical match that quality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As part of the re-branding, the companies will rename the property Sunset &amp; PCH. The complex, across the highway from seafood restaurant Gladstones, was built in 1989. The property was about 75 percent leased at the time of the sale. Broker Bob Safai at Madison Partners represented both buyers and the seller in the sale.</p>
