<p>In February 2013, Whole Foods Market announced plans to open a 40,000-square-foot store at the former Albertsons site in the Village Park shopping center, choosing Colleyville for its second Tarrant County location. The public/private partnership between the city and Centennial Real Estate Company that paved the way for Whole Foods also ensured an $18 million redevelopment of the aging center.</p>

<p>The ripple effect of that announcement continues to bode well for dining and shopping options in Colleyville. These days, signs of construction are everywhere at the shopping center, which has been rebranded &ldquo;Colleyville Downs,&rdquo; in honor of Colleyville&rsquo;s former horse racing track, Ross Downs. But commercial activity goes beyond Colleyville Downs. The Whole Foods announcement has helped foster interest in neighboring properties. In recent months, the Standridge Company announced plans to construct a retail development in the area north of Sonic. The development is called &ldquo;Colleyville Stampede,&rdquo; and Smashburger has already signed on as tenant there.</p>

<p>Centennial Real Estate has also purchased other land parcels in the area and is currently marketing those properties. Locations slated for redevelopment in preparation for future tenants are the former Sonic site and the space currently occupied by Rice King.</p>

<p>New businesses slated to open this year include: Whole Foods Market (late summer), Matt&rsquo;s Tex Mex (March), Einstein Bros. Bagels, Zoe&rsquo;s Kitchen. A major pet retailer may join the mix and announcements are expected about other new tenants in Colleyville Downs and neighboring centers.</p>

<p>During the past year, new businesses filled some of the vacant restaurant, retail, and office spaces, including: Bibbentucker&rsquo;s, Clockwork Gamer, Haute Lash &amp; Boutique, Machelle&rsquo;s, and Which Wich Sandwiches in Colleyville Town Center; Citrus Bistro and Vintage Tex in Colleyville Plaza East; Pizza Hut in Colleyville Town Square; The Londoner in the former Applebee&rsquo;s building; Tete-A-Tete (3919 Colleyville Blvd.); Colleyville Medical Clinic (6400 Colleyville Blvd.); Davenport Motor Company (6800 Colleyville Blvd.); Nizza Pizza and Pho Duy in Glade Points; The Tennant Institute in The Village; and the corporate offices of Standard Insurance Agency (8190 Precinct Line Road).</p>

<p>The economic development team has targeted small office and medical facilities for the past few years as prime business suitable to a Colleyville location. In the past year, Colleyville has seen an upsurge in office space, both in spec and build-to-suit buildings. And things have been going well on the medical front, as well. U.S. Memory Care opened its first Texas location a year ago, which turned out to be the kick-off point for several other medical facilities. First Choice Emergency Room opened its sixth DFW facility in Colleyville in September. And construction has started on the new Baylor Healthcare/Emerus Emergency Medical Center &ndash; Colleyville. The 17,000-square-foot hospital facility is scheduled to open by late summer.</p>

<p>The ripple effect of office and medical tenants is significant. Business office space and new medical facilities mean more people working in Colleyville&mdash;and that increases our daytime population, something restaurants and retailers consider when choosing a new location or site.</p>
