<p><strong>Centennial&rsquo;s New Focus</strong></p>

<p><em style="line-height:1.6">With an acquisition from Westfield, the company is the new kid on the block in the regional mall business. But the company has a history that is rich in retail, and in creating successful centers.</em></p>

<p>The regional mall has come back into focus for a new group of investors as many larger owners have begun to concentrate their capital and strengths on stronger assets in key markets. That&rsquo;s causing larger players to sell centers that are further afield from their current investment targets. What is out of focus for larger owners has become a strong opportunity for a new set of owners in the industry &mdash; those seeing the upside in investing in regional malls in primary and secondary markets that are the main retail hubs of their areas.</p>

<p>In 2015, Westfield elected to sell several of its centers in a portfolio to refocus capital on its development pipeline. For industry insiders, the move wasn&rsquo;t surprising, but the industry did a double take when Dallas-based Centennial Real Estate Company was the announced purchaser of five of the centers in December for $1.1 billion. No one doubted Centennial&rsquo;s ability to execute &mdash; the company has sound financial backing from USAA Real Estate and Montgomery Street Partners. Rather, the surprise came from Centennial&rsquo;s desire to jump into the super-regional mall business. Until that point, the company was known as an investor/operator of town centers and power centers, with a few regional malls under ownership. Buying five malls from Connecticut to California seemed a big stretch for the company. For Centennial&rsquo;s founder and CEO, Steven Levin, it was the perfect opportunity to create the company he had always wanted to build.</p>

<p>SCB recently met with Levin and Centennial&rsquo;s chief operating officer, Dan Sheridan, at the company&rsquo;s Dallas headquarters for our cover story this year.</p>
