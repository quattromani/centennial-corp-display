<p>Centennial Real Estate Company, LLC, in partnership with Corinthian Apartment Investments and The Praedium Group, has acquired The &Eacute;lan at Bluffview, a mixed-use multi-family and retail development in the heart of Dallas, Texas.</p>

<p>Located at 3850 W. Northwest Highway in Dallas, between Midway and Marsh, the mixed-use complex features 181 luxury one- and two-bedroom apartments with lofts ranging from 900 to 2,000 square feet. The property, which is 95 percent occupied, includes a stunning cascading pool in a private courtyard, high-end fitness center and Club Suite.</p>

<p>The 70,000 square feet of retail space was originally built in the 1980s and is currently 30 percent leased. It features the popular Italian restaurant Bugatti&rsquo;s. The &Eacute;lan at Bluffview is convenient to Northpark, the Dallas Design District and Uptown and centrally located near the prestigious Bluffview and Preston Hollow neighborhoods.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a great urban infill location. Such a high quality property near Dallas&#39; most prestigious neighborhoods provides a stellar opportunity to reposition the retail and lift it to the &Eacute;lan apartments&rsquo; upscale standards,&rdquo; said Centennial Real Estate CEO Steven Levin. &ldquo;There is also an unprecedented opportunity for a restaurant with a spacious patio that would enjoy a view overlooking a creek and a greenbelt. There is no comparable space like this available along Northwest Highway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Doug Gunn, Managing Partner of Corinthian, added, &ldquo;The apartments are state of the art with amenities at the top of the line. The residents are primarily working in Preston Center, downtown and the medical center area.&rdquo;</p>
