<p>A Dallas real estate investment company has made one of the largest shopping center buys in the country this year, acquiring five regional malls in a deal valued at more than $1 billion.&nbsp;Centennial Real Estate Co. teamed up with USAA Real Estate and Montgomery Street Partners to purchase the malls from Australia-based Westfield Corp.</p>

<p>The purchase includes shopping centers in California, Illinois, Connecticut and Washington State.<br />
  &ldquo;These are excellent malls &ndash; high quality regional centers in major markets,&rdquo; said Steven Levin, Centennial Real Estate&rsquo;s chief executive officer. &ldquo;They are in irreplaceable locations where you can&rsquo;t build today.&nbsp;&ldquo;They provide a tremendous opportunity for us.&rdquo;<br />
  <br />
  The shopping centers contain more than 6 million square feet of space and are 97 percent leased.&nbsp;Levin said previous owner Westfield made significant upgrades to the properties but decided to reduce its U.S. holdings.<br />
  <br />
  &ldquo;We started working with them about a year ago,&rdquo; Levin said. &ldquo;This sale took a long time.&rdquo;<br />
  <br />
  The acquisition marks a huge increase in activity for Centennial, which has been in business since 1997.&nbsp;The company already owned two shopping malls in Colorado and California.<br />
  <br />
  In the Dallas area, Centennial owns smaller shopping centers in Allen, Richardson, Colleyville, Flower Mound, Dallas and Mesquite.&nbsp;Levin said the shopping malls the firm just purchased have already made the transition for a new generation of shoppers.<br />
  <br />
  &ldquo;Malls are not just about shopping anymore,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The really good malls are also about dining, entertainment, fitness and a variety of uses to make people go there.&nbsp;&ldquo;These are malls that have been really well maintained and brought into the current evolution of where the business is going.&rdquo;<br />
  <br />
He said its Centennial&rsquo;s first such deal with San Antonio-based USAA Real Estate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are spectacular financial partners and we hope to do more with them.&rdquo;</p>
