        <p>At Centennial, we realize that our properties can’t be the hub of a neighborhood without connecting to the community in a meaningful way, whether that means partnering with community leaders to answer the call for natural disaster support, opening the doors of a shopping center to spread community awareness initiatives, being an industry partner and thought leader, or mentoring the next generation of retail entrepreneurs. The list goes on, and it will grow exponentially as Centennial continues to define what it means to be a best-in-class and socially engaged organization with an expectation for excellence in everything we touch.</p>
