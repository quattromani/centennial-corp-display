    <p>Long before the doors at Centennial opened, its story was being shaped by the world of retail.  Centennial founder and CEO Steven Levin grew up surrounded by the joys and nuances of retail.  His father launched his own value-price women’s store, where Steven worked from a young age.  Eventually, Steven took command of the company and grew it into a chain of 60 stores throughout the Southwest.<br><br>

    Ultimately, this retail path led Steven to launch Centennial in 1997 focusing on the investment, development and management of neighborhood centers.  Having evolved the portfolio, Centennial now focuses on the acquisition and transformation of regional shopping centers.  Drawing from an authentic heritage and a retailer’s perspective, Centennial has the expertise and desire to create modern, community-centric destinations for the next generation. </p>
