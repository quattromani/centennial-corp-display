sustainability-title: "Fox Valley Rain Barrel Art"
sustainability-text: "In October, 2017 Fox Valley Mall hosted an exhibit to teach homeowners how to conserve water by landscaping with native plants and how to conserve water by using rain barrels. Ten 55-gallon rain barrels were on display, each hand painted with nature themes by artists from the DuPage Art League.  A silent auction was held in conjunction with educational events about how to use of rain barrels.  Proceeds benefitted the Conservation Foundation."
