description: A Powerful And Vital Community Hub. Chico Mall is California's largest retail property north of Sacramento and the only enclosed regional mall within a 45-mile radius. The center is ideally located, with good visibility and easy access from Highway 99. In 2012, a floor-to-ceiling renovation dramatically improved the look and feel with updated entrance ways, signage, flooring, decor and a new food court. Dick's Sporting Goods, Justice, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Crazy 8, Maurice's, rue21, Francesca's and Torrid have all opened at the center, further broadening the tenant mix and enhancing value.
