sustainability-title: "Hawthorn Mall Energy Efficiency"
sustainability-text: "In 2016, Hawthorn Mall embarked on a $1.6 million central heating and cooling system modernization program, participating in ComEd’s Energy Efficiency Program by way of a $192,000 rebate incentive.  The new equipment will help the center realize approximately $160,000 in electrical savings each year, while reducing consumption over 1.4 million kWh per year, which is the equivalent to the full year’s energy use of 129 homes. In addition, Hawthorn works with ComEd to “shed power” during times of use, like very hot summer days, which helps to prevent power interruptions in the greater community."
