sustainability-title: "Hawthorn Earth Day Expo"
sustainability-text: "Working daily with retailers to recycle cardboard, Hawthorn Mall diverted an impressive 272 tons of waste from landfills in 2017. To highlight the mallâ€™s recycling efforts and engage the community, Hawthorn teamed up with Keter Environmental Services for their first Earth Day Expo on April 22, 2018. This one-of-a-kind event welcomed visitors for eco-friendly activities throughout the day, including a cardboard challenge to build something creative solely out of recycled cardboard. The event brought meaningful value to the SEE Centennial program by uniting retailers, community partners, mall management and consumers."
