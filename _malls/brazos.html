description: A STRATEGICALLY LOCATED CENTER PRIMED TO BENEFIT FROM CENTENNIALâ€™S RETAIL HERITAGE. Brazos Mall is the only regional mall in Brazoria County and houses over 80 retail stores in addition to its anchor stores. In 2018, the mall completed a $25 million redevelopment project that reconfigured existing space to add a new retail lineup including TJ Maxx, HomeGoods, Ashley HomeStore and Ulta Beauty. The mall also received an interior remodel that modernized the food court, and touched flooring, lighting, and soft seating throughout the center. With this revitalization, Brazos Mall will capture the excitement of the new retail experience tailored to the contemporary-conscious consumer that has long been associated with Brazos Mall.

# Commitment to Communities
CTC: true
CTC-title: "Brazos Aids in Hurricane Aftermath"
CTC-text: "In the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, Brazos Mall could utilize its position on dry ground to become a central disaster relief donation and distribution site to help those in need.  Brazos partnered with Salvation Army to become a designated disaster relief center where personal hygiene products, baby items, and other basic supplies were distributed daily to hundreds of local residents.  The center also joined United Way with multiple community organizations to host a donation drive that collected 13,522 relief items. 160 volunteers came out to unload, inventory, and help organize for distribution."
