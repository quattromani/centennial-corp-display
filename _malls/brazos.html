# Commitment to Communities
CTC: true
CTC-title: "Brazos Aids in Hurricane Aftermath"
CTC-text: "In the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, Brazos Mall could utilize its position on dry ground to become a central disaster relief donation and distribution site to help those in need.  Brazos partnered with Salvation Army to become a designated disaster relief center where personal hygiene products, baby items, and other basic supplies were distributed daily to hundreds of local residents.  The center also joined United Way with multiple community organizations to host a donation drive that collected 13,522 relief items. 160 volunteers came out to unload, inventory, and help organize for distribution."
